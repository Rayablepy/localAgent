# Charles

A personal AI assistant built on LangChain Deep Agents and LangGraph, running completely free of charge by using the free OpenRouter API and LM studio.

The goal: an assistant with real memory, real tools, and real access to your own files and data, all to streamline workflows and improve productivity
as an all-in-one agent

---

## Overview

`Charles` combines three subsystems into one coherent assistant:

- **Agent core** — a Deep Agent (planning, tool use, context management) served by OpenRouter
- **Retrieval (RAG)** — a local vector store over your own documents, exposed to the agent as a tool
- **Tools & persistence** — filesystem, notes, calendar, and other tools, backed by local storage

---

## Features

### Current
- [x] Model served via OpenRouter API
- [x] Deep Agent core with planning and context management (via `deepagents`)
- [x] Local document embedding and retrieval pipeline (Chroma)
- [x] Conversational memory across sessions (LangGraph checkpointer)
- [x] Scoped filesystem access tool
- [x] Notes / todo tool with local persistence
### In progress / planned
- [ ] Web search tool
- [ ] Desktop app and UI using React and Electron
- [ ] Calendar and email integration (read-only first)
- [ ] MCP server support for third-party apps
- [ ] Human-in-the-loop approval for sensitive actions (sending messages, deleting files, running shell commands)
- [ ] Voice input/output

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Agent framework | LangChain `deepagents` + LangGraph |
| Model serving | OpenRouter/LM studio |
| Vector store | Chroma |
| Persistence | SQLite |

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rayablepy/localAgent.git
cd localAgent
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   
```

Requires [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) (or another OpenAI-compatible local server) running at `http://localhost:1234/v1` with JIT loading enabled and an OpenRouter API key.

```bash
python -m execution.py cli
```
